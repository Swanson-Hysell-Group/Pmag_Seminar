Dig into the guts of: ipmag.igrf, pmag.doigrf and pmag.magsyn. Compare 5 ipmag.igrf calculations with calculations using: https://github.com/cmweiss/geomag and [online calculator](http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag-web/#igrfwmm). Check IGRF-12 coefficients in pmag.get_igrf12. Improve docstrings in ipmag.igrf, pmag.doigrf and pmag.magsyn. Make sure functions are consistent within mk_sam_utilities.py.|
|09/16/16| Read [Essentials Chapter 9](https://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch9.html). Have a look at [Essentials Chapter 11](https://earthref.org/MagIC/books/Tauxe/Essentials/WebBook3ch11.html). Use pmag_gui (link to executable [here](https://github.com/PmagPy/PmagPy-Standalone-OSX/releases/tag/1.1.1)) to convert PI47-.sam to MagIC and then using demag_gui to make the fits. Record the Fisher mean you get for the LT and HT fits and we will compare. |
